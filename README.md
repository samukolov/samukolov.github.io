### This repo contains source code of my [Web Resume](https://samukolov.github.io/ "Sam's web resume")

Content:
1. Just me, myself and I
*Fun fact: my first name is actually Viacheslav, but due to series of mispronunciations and weird associations it became Sam. I have to admit though, I kinda like it :)*
2. My humble experience
*Started as a computer engineer but laterwards decided to enrich myself with designing skills. Nevertheless my projects always were programing based and technology oriented, they just became more user friendly and pleasent for the eye*
3. My alma mater
4. My superpowers
5. More stuff about me
