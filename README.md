### This repo contains source code of my [Web Resume](https://samukolov.github.io/ "Sam's web resume")

Content:
1. Just me, myself and I.

   *Fun fact: my first name is actually Viacheslav, but due to series of mispronunciations and weird associations it became Sam.*
   *I have to admit though, I kinda like it :)*

2. My humble experience.

   *Started as a computer engineer but laterwards decided to enrich myself with designing skills.*
   *Nevertheless, my projects were programing based and technology oriented, they just became more user friendly and pleasent for the eye*
3. My alma mater.

   *Long story short, per aspera ad astra*
4. My superpowers.

5. More stuff about me.
   *More. More! MORE!!! Additional information, links and files about me*
